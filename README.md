# fRescalo
R rewrite of Hill (2012; DOI:10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00146.x) fortran code available at https://www.brc.ac.uk/biblio/frescalo-computer-program-analyse-your-biological-records

This code was mainly written to aid understanding of the paper. Note that Dr Jon Yearsley has also provided what looks like a much faster R version of Frescalo here: https://github.com/DrJonYearsley/frescaloR
